cd snake-piston
cargo run
# Have fun...
```

# How to play
Simply move the Snake around using the keyboard arrows and eat apples. The more apples you eat the more points you gain and the more the Snake goes faster.
The following keys are recognised

 * **UP/RIGHT/DOWN/LEFT** to move the Snake
 * **ESC** Quit
 * **R** Restart
 * **P** Pause

If you press an arrow which is the opposite of the snake's direction, it dies.
